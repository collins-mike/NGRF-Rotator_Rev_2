1.) Add new equipmet to appropriate list which will be one of the fololwing .csv files located in the 
	"src/calibration" directory, and will be one of the following:
	
		antennaList.csv :for antennas
		preampList.csv	:for preamplifiers
		cableList.csv	:for cables
	
	Information should be formatted the same as the previous entries with the name of the 
	equipment in the first collumn and the filename in the second collumn. the information 
	will be automatically found by the program as long as it is in the correct location.
	
2.)add new equipment calibration data as its own .csv file to the appropriate directory; which 
	will be one of the following:

		"src/calibration/antennas"	: for antennas
		"src/calibration/preamps"	: for preamplifiers
		"src/calibration/cables"	: for cables	
	
	the calibration data should be formatted in 2 or 3 columns as follows

		note:	data will be automatically added if files are properly formatted and
			in the correct folder

insert j

	a.)for antennas

		   Column A 		   column B		   column C
row1		Frequency in MHz|	Gain in dBi	|	AFE in dB/m
row2		data1		|	gain1		|	AFE1
row3		data2		|	gain2		|	AFE2
row4		"		|	"		|	"
row5		"		|	"		|	"	
row6		"		|	"		|	"
row7		"		|	"		|	"	


	b.)for Pramplifiers

row5		"		|	"			
row6		"		|	"		
row7		"		|	"	

	b.)for cables

		   Column A, 		   column B
